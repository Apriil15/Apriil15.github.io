I saw [this website](https://pjchender.dev/) at first, then saw one of my friend using it.\\n\\nWhat it attracts my attention is:\\n\\n- Having dark theme natively\\n\\n- A standard theme that it\'s just the style I like\\n\\n- Dinosaur is cute :grinning:\\n\\nPersonal opinions:\\n\\n- I would have trouble making decisions if there are too many themes like Hugo.\\n\\n- After I pick up one theme, maybe it is lack of some features important for me, like dark theme.\\n\\n- Then I fall into a kind of for loop `choose -> drop`, and waste much time.\\n\\nAfter using Docusaurus what I find:\\n\\n- Documentation is clear\\n\\n- Using GitHub Actions is so easy (actually, it\'s my first time to use it)\\n\\nEvery static website framework has its pros and cons, I recommend giving all of them a try, and you can choose what meet your requirements.\\n\\nFinally, hello Docusaurus! :clap:\\n\\n![docusaurus](./docusaurus.jpeg)"}]}')}}]);
