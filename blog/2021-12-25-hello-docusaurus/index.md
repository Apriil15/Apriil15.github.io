So, today I move my personal website from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (technically yesterday, because it's 12/26 now)

Actually I have known Docusaurus for a few days. I saw [this website](https://pjchender.dev/) at first, then saw one of my friend using it.

What it attracts my attention is:

- Having dark theme natively

- A standard theme that it's just the style I like

- Dinosaur is cute :grinning:

Personal opinions:

- I would have trouble making decisions if there are too many themes like Hugo.

- After I pick up one theme, maybe it is lack of some features important for me, like dark theme.

- Then I fall into a kind of for loop `choose -> drop`, and waste much time.

After using Docusaurus what I find:

- Documentation is clear

- Using GitHub Actions is so easy (actually, it's my first time to use it)

Every static website framework has its pros and cons, I recommend giving all of them a try, and you can choose what meet your requirements.

Finally, Hello Docusaurus! :clap:
